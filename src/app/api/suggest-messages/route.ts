Create a list of three open-ended and engaging questions formatted
as a single string. Each question should be separated by "||".

These questions are for an anonymous social messaging platform,
like Qooh.me, and should be suitable for a diverse audience.

Avoid personal or sensitive topics. Focus on universal themes that
encourage friendly interaction.

Example:
What's a hobby you've recently started?||
If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?||
What's a simple thing that makes you happy?

Ensure the questions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute
to a positive and welcoming conversational environment.
